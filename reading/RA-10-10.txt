Confession: Preparing to present in another class stole my reading time for
this class. I did not read this paper in its entirety.

1. What problem did the authors try to solve?

The authors are interested in determining whether social book marking is useful
for websearch.

2. Why is the problem significant to solve in the first place?

There is a lot of data on ssites like delicious. However, I'm suspicious that
data sources like delicious are ever going to be big enough to really matter
for web scale search. For local search, the data doesn't even exist. From the
abstract and intro it sounded like it would help if we only had the data. We
don't, so its not a terribly significant result in my opinion.

3. What is the methodology the authors have adopted in solving the problem?

4. Is the performance evaluation of the proposed solution technically sound
and complete? Explain why.

5. Do you have any questions regarding the paper? If so, list them.
