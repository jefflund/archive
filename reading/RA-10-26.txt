1. What problem did the authors try to solve?

The authors are trying to solve the problem of query recomendation when the
user issues a vague or poorly formated query.

2. Why is the problem significant to solve in the first place?

As stated in the paper, users looking for information on things they are not
familiar with may issue poorly formatted queries due to lack of familiarity
with the correct keywords.

3. What is the methodology the authors have adopted in solving the problem?

The authors use two metrics, namely query term overlap and query result overlap
to find queries which have some overlap in results, but little overlap in
queries. The idea is that they'll find queries which are "orthogonal" to the
orignal query.

4. Is the performance evaluation of the proposed solution technically sound
and complete? Explain why.

After extensive experimentation with a large query log to determine the best
cache policy, the authors rely on a user study to conclude that several known
approaches, especially on queries in the long tail.

5. Do you have any questions regarding the paper? If so, list them.

Figure 1 perplexes me. It seems like if they just did a better job of standard
query recommendation, they might have better precision and recall since the
orthogal query is such a thin slice of the relevant results and contains so
many irrelevant results. Apparently this works well for tail queries, but maybe
some hybrid approach using this for tail, and standard for the more common
queries would do better still?
