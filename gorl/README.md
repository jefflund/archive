# GoRL

GoRL is a (somewhat) generic roguelike toolkit for Go. It is intended mostly
for development of my own vaporware roguelike project [Sticks and
Stones](https://github.com/jefflund/stones), but should be generally useful for
various roguelikes. Gorl is written entirely in [Go](https://golang.org) and
utilizes [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go) for display so it
should be usable on all major platforms.

## Features

* Entity-Component System
* Behavior Trees
* Delta Clock Scheduling
* Various Map Generators
* Logging Format Language
* High Quality RNG
* Terminal IO
* Data-Bound UI Widgets

## Getting Started

If you are new to GoRL and want to get started, I recommend giving a quick
glance at the docs (linked below). The examples in particular can help you get
your barrings and see how the various features in GoRL fit together.
