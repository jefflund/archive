# Sticks and Stones

Sticks and Stones is yet another vaporware roguelike project. The project
relies on [GoRL](http://github.com/jefflund/gorl) and is intended to be an
open-world survival roguelike set in the Stone Age. The gameplay mechanics are
based the Habilis system created by [UNIgames](http://unigames.us) for
Cavemaster RPG. The project has been plagued by numerous rewrites, redesigns,
and real life deadlines. Furthermore, the intended scope of the project means
that I can be continually side-tracked with interesting and fun problems. Being
vaporware, no release date has been given, but the author promises that one is
forthcoming...
