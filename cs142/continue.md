    * Teaches C++ and introduces programming
  * CS 235 - Data structures (super important class)
    * Majority of programming job interview questions come from here
    * Teaches you about the inner workings of important data structures
      * vector, map, set, queue internals for example
    * Teaches you when to use a particular data structure
  * CS 236 - Discrete Structures
    * Gives basics mathematical foundations for talking about cs theory
  * CS 240 - Advanced Programming
    * Throws big projects at you to see if you are up to snuff
    * Required to register for higher level CS courses
  * Two more of your choice for the minor
* Other goodies
  * CS 124 - Intro to Computer Systems
    * Goes over how computers work at a low level from transistors up to C
    * Important for low level systems programming
  * CS 312 - Algorithm Analysis
    * Gives you tools to analyze algorithmic runtime
    * Covers some of the classical algorithms which are used all over the place
  * CS 252 - Intro to Theory
    * Covers basics of CS theory, including intro to complexity theory
    * Heavy in the math, but very fun
