# CS 142
This repository contains code examples used in my CS 142 lectures at BYU.
Each directory contains one example. Some examples may be compilable,
while others may be just code snippets. Here are the examples I have
included so far:

* hello - a simple hello world program
* escape - demonstrates escape sequences to format output (lab 1 essentially)
* vending - uses remainder to compute change from vending machine (similar to lab 2)
* fizzbuzz - solved the famous interview question to introduce loops
* pi - monte carlo computation of pi (shows use of rand)
* dice - uses loops, has menus, input validation (similar to lab 4)
* dice2 - same as dice2, but with functions (similar to lab 5)
* conway - demonstrates 2d arrays, but only runs in unix (similar to lab 6)
* cards - illustrates a shuffle (useful for lab 7)
* lisp - silly example illustrating something you could not do without pointers
* greeter - overdone hello world to demo basics of classes
* input - shows how both ifstream and cin are just istream's
* register - classes in cash register example (similar to lab 8)
* shapes - demonstrates inheritance and virtual methods
* vector - demonstrates operator overloading with a (mathematical) vector class
* sudoko - solves sudoku to demonstrate recursion
