evilplot
========

Wrapper around PyLab support the types of data inputs that I typically generate with ModelT.
Initially, this won't be useful for anyone but myself, but eventually I will add multiple
backends (including gnuplot and pgfplots) and have various ways of importing and defining
plot data.
