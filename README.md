# CS 142
This repository contains code examples used in my CS 142 lectures at BYU.
Each directory contains one example. Some examples may be compilable,
while others may be just code snippets. Here are the examples I have
included so far:

* hello - a simple hello world program
* escape - demonstrates escape sequences to format output (lab 1 essentially)
* vending - uses remainder to compute change from vending machine (similar to lab 2)
* fizzbuzz - solved the famous interview question to introduce loops
* pi - monte carlo computation of pi (shows use of rand)
