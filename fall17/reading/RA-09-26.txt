1. What problem did the authors try to solve?

The authors are trying to resolve the differences between specific user tags
(personomies) and the collective tags of an entire community (folksonomies).

2. Why is the problem significant to solve in the first place?

This work is helpful for sites which produces broad folksonomies such as
Delicious.

3. What is the methodology the authors have adopted in solving the problem?

The authors start with a tensor encoding items, users and tags to represent a
folksonomy. They also compute a cooccurence matrix between items and tags, and
use the two to compute a translation matrix on a per user basis. Multiplying
the cooccurrence matrix with the translation matrix and normalizing gives
recomendation scores to the user from the folksomony.

4. Is the performance evaluation of the proposed solution technically sound
and complete? Explain why.

They evaluate by taking two tagged datasets, witholding 10% of the tags for
testing, and measuring precision and recall predicting the missing test tags.
I think this is technically sound, although I would be wary of equating the
precision numbers on this test set with values in the real world. I feel this
way since the goal is to predict tags the user missed, and even if you include
the missing 10% I would expect there to be additional relevant tags.
Nevertheless, since we know the 10% are valid, predicting those tags is good,
so higher precision numbers are better here, even if they aren't comparable
with real world application.

5. Do you have any questions regarding the paper? If so, list them.

How much data do you need from a user personomy for this method to be
effective? It seems to me that most users will have very few tags, so I wonder
how well this will work for those users.
