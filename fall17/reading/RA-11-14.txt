1. What problem did the authors try to solve?

The authors are trying to characterize web content both by reading level and by
topic.

2. Why is the problem significant to solve in the first place?

This is useful for helping to understand how users at different reading levels
use search. Potentially, this information could be used to customize search
engines based on reading level of the user.

3. What is the methodology the authors have adopted in solving the problem?

As far as how they predict reading level, they say surprisingly little: just
that it was a language model approach and almost nothing else. For topic
prediction, they use logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization
trained on Open Directory Project. They then use these results to build what
they call profiles based on entities (which can be urls, users, or queries).

4. Is the performance evaluation of the proposed solution technically sound
and complete? Explain why.

Overall, I thought the correlations they discovered were interesting, though
the comparisons weren't terribly meaningful.

5. Do you have any questions regarding the paper? If so, list them.

How do the authors intend to actually use the information they uncovered with
this analysis?
