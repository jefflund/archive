  author={Gomez-Uribe, Carlos A and Hunt, Neil},
  journal={ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems},
  year={2016},
  annotate={This article details the Netflix recommender system. It turns out that the system is not one algorithm, but many different algorithms combined in one. However, many of these algorithms utilize proprietary data. In truth, I am citing this paper for the statistic that 80\% of hours streamed at Netflix were influenced by their recommender system.},

    annotate={This is the textbook used when I took the undergraduate information retrieval class. Here I specifically cite it for information on how collaborate filtering is performed in a user centric manner, namely by finding the most similar users to a particular user with k-nearest neighbor clustering and predicting based on the cluster preferences.},

    annotate={A broad overview of how matrix factorization can be used to perform collaborative filtering. A user-item matrix is factorized into two matrices where the inner dimension represents latent-factors. Given a user-profile, the latent factors for that user are computed, and then items which correspond to those latent factors are recommended.},
