This project will contain some very basic experiments in Hugo, bootstrap.js,
ds.js, and simple web front end stuff. To my own detriment, I've neglected to
learn these things, so this project is my playground for catching up. The end
goal however, is to produce a Hugo theme which could be used for a website
(specifically a travel blog).
